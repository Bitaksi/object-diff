# object diff

Get the minimal patch to extend literal object A with to transform it into
literal object B

Consider an object retrieved from a server:

```js
{
	name: 'Peter',
	age: 26,
	height: 187,
}
```

Now the user changes stuff using some frontend (e.g. a HTML form) and ends with:

```js
{
	name: 'Peter',
	age: 27,
	height: 186,
}
```

When they hit save, you only want to send off the changed parts to the servers,
to save bits (because you're indeed a programmer), but also to avoid any
unnecessary "merge conflicts" at the server.

Imagine two users changing the same object; if they did not change the exact
same keys of the object, the last user won't erase the first user's changes - in
a lot of cases, that's the expected behavior.

## Usage

```js
const diff = require('object-diff')

const a = {
	speed: 4,
	power: 54,
	height: undefined,
	level: 1,
}

const b = {
	speed: 4, // unchanged
	power: 22, // changed
	level: undefined, // changed
	weight: 10, // added
}

diff(a, b)
/*
{
	power: 22,
	level: undefined,
	weight: 10,
}
*/

// using a custom equality function

const past = '2016-04-24T10:39:23.419Z'

diff.custom(
	(a, b) => {
		if (a instanceof Date && b instanceof Date) {
			return a.getTime() === b.getTime()
		}
		return a === b
	},
	{
		then: new Date(past),
	},
	{
		then: new Date(past),
	}
)
/*
{}
*/
```
